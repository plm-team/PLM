The PLM (Peripheral Language Model) series introduces a novel model architecture to peripheral computing by delivering powerful language capabilities within the constraints of resource-limited devices. Through modeling and system co-design strategy, PLM optimizes model performance and fits edge system requirements, PLM employs **Multi-head Latent Attention** and **squared ReLU** activation to achieve sparsity, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational demands. Coupled with a meticulously crafted training regimen using curated datasets and a Warmup-Stable-Decay-Constant learning rate scheduler, PLM demonstrates superior performance compared to existing small language models, all while maintaining the lowest activated parameters, making it ideally suited for deployment on diverse peripheral platforms like mobile phones and Raspberry Pis.

## PLM Hightlight

PLM demonstrates highly competitive performance along with a series of advantages stemming from its modeling and system co-design. These benefits include impressive inference speed, extreme sparsity, and reduced KV cache due to MLA, enabling it to outperform models with the same number of layers when handling long-context inference tasks at certain sequence lengths.


- **Sparse** (Less activated parameters but better performance)

- **High efficiency** (Generate content with low latency while having a good quality)

## How to use PLM

Here we introduce some methods to use PLM models.

### Hugging Face

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("PLM-Team/PLM-1.8B-Instruct")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("PLM-Team/PLM-1.8B-Instruct", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)

# Input text
input_text = "Tell me something about reinforcement learning."
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Completion
output = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_new_tokens=100)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

### llama.cpp

The original contribution to the llama.cpp framwork is [Si1w/llama.cpp](https://github.com/Si1w/llama.cpp). Here is the usage:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Si1w/llama.cpp.git
cd llama.cpp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, we can build with CPU of GPU (e.g. Orin). The build is based on `cmake`. 

- For CPU

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

- For GPU

```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Don't forget to download the GGUF files of the PLM. We use the quantization methods in `llama.cpp` to generate the quantized PLM.

```bash
huggingface-cli download --resume-download PLM-Team/PLM-1.8B-Instruct-gguf --local-dir PLM-Team/PLM-1.8B-Instruct-gguf
```

After build the `llama.cpp`, we can use `llama-cli` script to launch the PLM.

```bash
./build/bin/llama-cli -m ./PLM-Team/PLM-1.8B-Instruct-gguf/PLM-1.8B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf -cnv -p "hello!" -n 128
```

## Future works

- [ ] Release vLLM, SGLang, and PowerInfer inference scripts for PLM.
- [ ] Release reasoning model trained on PLM.
- [ ] Release vision model based on PLM.
